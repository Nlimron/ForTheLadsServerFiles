# ForTheLadsServerFiles
Okay you nerds.
First make sure you have downloaded all of the files from the github site.
You also need to download this one separately, https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/betterend/files
Make sure to download the 0.9.6-pre.jar file.
Next you need to run the fabric-installer, once it has opened you need to make sure that in the top
left of the installer the "client" tab is selected.
It should auto select Minecraft Version: 1.16.5, make sure the box labled Create profile is ticked,
and now go ahead and click install.
Once it is installed you need to open the minecraft launcher and change your profile to the left of the
play button to the "fabric-loader" profile then click play and let minecraft launch.
After Minecraft has launched close out of the game and open your ".minecraft" directory which can be found
by typing "%appdata%" into your windows search bar or if you can't find it there try
following this path (ThisPC>LocalDisk>Users>[YourUser]>AppData>Roaming). Once in that folder open the folder
labled "mods" if you don't have one then you can go ahead and create a new folder and name it that.
Next make sure that all of the ".jar" files you have downloaded (some are in .zip files, right click and extract these ones) 
are placed into your
"mods" folder. 
This means you should have mods from the "mods.zip" file, the "these mods as well", and the "origins mods" files as well as the
better end mod from the link at the top of this README file.
The only file that doesn't go in there is the fabric-installer.
Once all of the mods are in the folder you are all set to start playing, go ahead and close any files you still
have open and boot up minecraft, and pray to the mod gods that it works!
