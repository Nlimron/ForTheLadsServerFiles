# ForTheLadsServerFiles
Okay you nerds.
First make sure you have downloaded all of the files from the github site.
You also need to download this one separately, https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/betterend/files/3203464
Next you need to run the fabric-installer, once it has opened you need to make sure that in the top
left of the installer the "client" tab is selected.
It should auto select Minecraft Version: 1.16.5, make sure the box labled Create profile is ticked,
and now go ahead and click install.
Once it is installed you need to open the minecraft launcher and change your profile to the left of the
play button to the "fabric-loader" profile then click play and let minecraft launch.
After Minecraft has launched close out of the game and open your ".minecraft" directory which can be found
by typing "%appdata%" into your windows search bar or if you can't find it there try
following this path (ThisPC>LocalDisk>Users>[YourUser]>AppData>Roaming). Once in that folder open the folder
labled "mods" if you don't have one then you can go ahead and create a new folder and name it that.
Next you need to place all of the following files into your "mods" folder
(cloth-config,fabric-api,flytr_lib,RoughlyEnoughItems,better-end) The fist 4 mods are inside of the "Mods.zip" file you downloaded, the last one is the external link at the start of this note.
Once all of those mods are in the folder you are all set to start playing, go ahead and close any files you still
have open and boot up minecraft, and pray to the mod gods that it works!
